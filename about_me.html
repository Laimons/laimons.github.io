	<h1>Hello, Chap!</h1>
	<p>I am Laimons and from age of 16, I have been working in the kitchen. I started in my family restaurant learning to do simple tasks, like peeling vegetables super fast, cooking pork chops, Latvian hearth warming kitchen. When I was 19 I applied to cook school in my hometown Valmiera.</p><br>
	<p>From there I went as an apprentice in restaurant "3" in Riga and I was amazed how the kitchen organized by one of the best chefs in Latvia was! It was a Scandinavian kitchen with a local twist. I learned their love for my profession. </p><br>
	<p>After that, I went to tour around central Europe. Traveled together with Ice skating show "Holiday on Ice". We did 13 cities in 3 months. Most of it was in Germany, but we did Brighton, and Vienna as well My role there was to cook food for the crew. Went to local shops to buy products (believe me it is hard to make nice dishes for 80 people just from Lidl) and make food in our set up kitchen. It was fun for sure!</p><br>
	<p>After the tour, Eindhoven was waiting for me. There I worked in Het Kettelhuis. Nice kitchen. Our chef did bring not just a part from animal to cook, but whole. We used all of it to make the biggest respects to the animal. The restaurant had its garden as well and we had such nice fresh products on daily basis.</p><br>
	<p>And I got back to Riga to start a new adventure in KOYA. KOYA is a Scandinavian-Asian restaurant. There I learned a lot about products from Asia such as Kombu, Tare, Miso, Ramen, different types of mushrooms, and so on. Together with KOYA head chef Pavels Skopa, we won chef of the year Latvia 2019 (I was his right hand). The competition was such a thrill, we did a lot of rehearsals before. Some of the rehearsals started at 5 in the morning so we can do it before my 14-hour shift starts ( yeah we chefs have insane hours to work just to deliver that nice plate that you guys like).</p><br>
	<p>After KOYA I wanted to challenge myself on the river cruises ships, just to see if I am that strong in body as in spirit. The Viking river cruises have a nice thing that they teach new staff members how their ships operate, so I had to go to Vienna to train myself about their standards. The training was for 2 weeks with different lectures about HAACAP, how to treat customers better and what kind of food they serve. Then my cruise should start in Cologne. My river cruise would be from Bazel, Switzerland to Amsterdam, Netherlands throughout river Rein. COVID ALERT!!! Cruise didn't start. I was one of few chosen who will stay at the harbor and cook food for the staff that maintained ships and we had to manage food logistics. At the harbor, there were at least 30 ships. Most of them are packed with food for the season. It was hard, just because of covid started and working every day for 3 months straight.</p><br> 
	<p>When finally that was over  I knew something was missing and yes that was SOURDOUGH bread. KATKEVICH team taught me how to bake sourdough bread from a scratch. at least 50 bread a day up to 300. We also did some nice carrots, spinach, ash, and beetroot baguettes. It was a true learning curve for me.</p><br>
	<p>Yet again something is missing, so I went to Whitehouse (not Washington, but in Riga) and tried my best to learn pastry, especially to learn to make chocolate candies with wonderful design and taste. I made candies like beetroot-quince, buckwheat, mango-passion etc.</p> <br>
	<p>Right now I am in the Norway writing this story and learning to program to create a new career for myself. Hope you enjoy the recipes that I will share with you! Wishing you all the best, Lemon!</p>
